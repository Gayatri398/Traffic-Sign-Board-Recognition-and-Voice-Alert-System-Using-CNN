# Traffic-Sign-Board-Recognition-and-Voice-Alert-System-Using-CNN
Traffic sign board recognition and voice alert systems are important components of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). They enhance road safety by alerting drivers about various traffic signs, such as speed limits, warnings, and other crucial instructions. Implementing such systems typically involves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition and integrating a voice alert system for real-time notifications.

Here's a detailed overview of how you can achieve traffic sign recognition and voice alerts using CNNs and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset:

1. Traffic Sign Board Recognition
Dataset: GTSRB
The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset is commonly used for training traffic sign recognition models. It contains images of traffic signs with various categories and conditions.

Dataset Contents: The dataset includes images of traffic signs categorized into various classes, such as speed limits, stop signs, and warning signs.
Classes: Each class represents a different type of traffic sign.
Images: The dataset provides images with annotations for training and evaluation.
Steps for Traffic Sign Recognition Using CNN:
Data Preparation:

Load and Preprocess Data: Load the GTSRB dataset and preprocess the images by resizing them, normalizing pixel values, and performing data augmentation to improve model robustness.
Split Data: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Model Building:

Define CNN Architecture: Design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture suitable for image classification. Common architectures include LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet.
Layers: Include convolutional layers, activation functions (e.g., ReLU), pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Compile Model: Use appropriate loss functions (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) and optimizers (e.g., Adam or SGD).
Training:

Train Model: Train the CNN on the GTSRB dataset using the training set and validate it using the validation set.
Evaluate Model: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss on the test set.
Testing and Inference:

Predict Traffic Signs: Use the trained model to predict traffic sign classes from new images.
2. Voice Alert System
Integration with Voice Alerts:
Voice Alert System:

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Use a text-to-speech library or API to convert text descriptions of traffic signs into spoken alerts. Libraries like gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) or built-in TTS engines in operating systems can be used.
Integration:

Real-time Detection: Implement real-time detection of traffic signs using the trained CNN model. Integrate the model into a system that captures images from a camera or video feed.
Generate Alerts: When a traffic sign is detected, generate an appropriate voice alert based on the recognized traffic sign category.
Play Sound: Use the TTS system to play the generated voice alert to the driver.

Training a CNN Model
Here’s a simplified example of a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras:


import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Define the CNN model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(val_images, val_labels))
Generating Voice Alerts
Here’s a simple example of generating a voice alert using gTTS:

python
Copy code
from gtts import gTTS
import os

def generate_voice_alert(text):
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en')
    tts.save("alert.mp3")
    os.system("mpg321 alert.mp3")  # Use a suitable player to play the sound

# Example usage
generate_voice_alert("Speed limit 50 km/h")
Summary
